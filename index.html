                Through the constant interplay between technological innovation
                and human-centered design, the evolution of user interfaces
                continues to mirror the ever-evolving relationship between
                humans and the natural world.

                <br />
                <span>
                  It is becoming increasingly clear that technology shouldn't
                  distance humans from the natural world, but should instead
                  strengthen their connection to it, as evidenced by the growth
                  of user interface design from its early utilitarian stages to
                  its current biophilic tendencies. The design of user
                  interfaces in the future appears set to more deeply interact
                  with the environment as technology develops. Some possible
                  scenarios are interfaces that respond to human emotions or
                  virtual reality experiences that transport users to tranquil
                  surroundings.

                  The term "biophilic design" has gained popularity in recent
                  years. The biologist Edward O. Wilson invented the term
                  "biophilia," which describes people's fundamental attachment
                  to nature. In order to build user interfaces that inspire a
                  sense of tranquillity and community, designers have started
                  combining elements from nature, such as organic shapes,
                  natural textures, and flowing animations. This strategy grows
                  from the rising understanding of the psychological advantages
                  of connecting with nature.

                  Google created the design language known as Material Design
                  with the goal of improving user interaction and experience on
                  all platforms and gadgets. It incorporates the capabilities of
                  digital technology while drawing inspiration from real-world
                  elements like paper and ink, utilizing subtle animations and
                  transitions to mimic how objects move and respond to user
                  interactions. Material UI design provides engaging,
                  understandable, and intuitive user interfaces.

                  A step away from imitating the physical world was made by the
                  rise of flat design and minimalism. These design approaches
                  placed a strong emphasis on simplicity, clarity, and
                  functionality. Interfaces adopted streamlined designs, vivid
                  hues, and spacious layouts. Indirectly reflecting the peace of
                  nature's simplicity, the trend toward minimalism represented a
                  desire to lighten users' cognitive load and offer a more
                  streamlined experience.

                  There was developed a skeuomorphic design, on the way to
                  provide user interfaces with even more real-world tangibility.
                  This design mimics the textures, materials and real-world
                  physical items. While this approach made interfaces feel more
                  like the physical world by increasing familiarity, it still
                  had many disadvantages, such as cluttered and confusing
                  interfaces.

                  Designers started introducing metaphorical components into
                  interfaces - icons of files, trash bins etc. - this helped
                  provide users with a familiar environment and close the gap
                  between the digital and the natural world. Although the user
                  experience was improved, there was still little link to the
                  surrounding world.

                  User interfaces in the early days of digital technology were
                  cut off from the natural environment. Functionality and
                  technological limitations took the first place, leaving
                  aesthetics and user experience as secondary considerations.
                  The UI consisted of text-based interfaces, monochromatic
                  screens, and little interactive content, limiting the amount
                  of user engagement.

                    Designing user interfaces for software or electronic devices
                    is a process that places a strong emphasis on aesthetics and
                    style. Interfaces should be simple to use and enjoyable for
                    users. (“What Is User Interface (UI) Design?,” 2023). While
                    UI design has undergone a huge evolution over time, there is
                    a significant aspect which is tightly connected to people's
                    well-being and cognition - a synchronisation between user
                    interfaces and the natural environment.
